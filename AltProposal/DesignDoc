## ERD:

## Role Hierarchy
* Supervisor
	* Instructor
		* Associate

## User Interface
* Data visualization
	* Utilizing the D3 Chart Library
	* displays charts based on pass/fail/release over time (month/year/all) and other factors
		* proposal: users should also enter information related to training itself, such as trailhead badges and points
			these could be used over time to determine correlations between failure and training and help improve the training program

* Cohort View

![view image](/revaturelabs/AchievementUnlocked/blob/main/images/wiki-images/cohort%20View.png)

	* list of associates that belong to a cohort
	* Status - (training, staging, selected, released)
		* proposal: select should have a by whom requirement, released should have a release reason requirement
	* Name - first and last name with optional alias/nickname
	* Voucher - voucher(s) they have been assigned
	* Certification status - certified, pending, ineligible, if ineligible when will they be eligible again
	* Attempts - how many attempts made, how many remaining per certification
	* Associates should have Assign button with due date for certifications
	* Should be able to bulk assign to associates (one, many, or all)
	* assignment button should be deactivated once delivered, should later update to say pending when registered to say used
	* filter: Status, Certification, Certification Status
	* sort: first name, last name, certification, status, certification status

* Associate View
	*

* Staging View
	* should be identical to the cohort view, but for all associates in staging regardless of cohort
	* default view of those with the status of staging
	* filter and sorting options shared with cohort view

## Page Layouts
* Actual Exam
* Practice Exam

## List Views
* Cohort View
* Staging View

## Triggers & Apex
* backend processioning for categories

## Process Automation
* Associates should receive an email when assigned a new certification

## Sales & Service Cloud
* should associates need to be able to create cases when having issues?
* if an instructor fails to meet an associates needs should it be escalated?

### Voucher Delivery
	* Associates should be able to see assigned vouchers, in distinct categories by type
	* Attempt date listed when completed & expiration date for voucher
	* Associates should receive email notification
### Certification Achievement
	* Associates need to be able to denote achievement status (Achieved, Failed, Pending)
		* pending needs to take in scheduled date, achieved needs date achieved, failed needs failed
			* proposal: a date is only added during pending
		* Any attempt recorded should have space to enter related category scores, scores should be totaled for overall score on exam
			* proposal: once the scheduled date has passed these fields appear automatically, the overall score is then used to determine pass/fail
		* Associates should be able to review their own exam scores only both overall and by category
			* proposal: a study order can be generated simply by sorting the categories by least to greatest
