 * Description: This component was made in preparation for adding an overview of associate data with the bar graphs.
 * This CMP WAS NOT USED.
 * 
 * The Plan: Similar to the cohortBarGraphIndex component. Write a callout to an apex controller that passes back overview data and then format it
 * into an array to pass to the barGraphIndex component.
